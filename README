# Introduction
This is now a simple implementation of SNMP v1 written in Rust.
THe **Goal** of this Repo is to implement series of SNMP protocols(ie v1,v2,v3) by scratch without third-party crates


# Feature
- [x] ASN.1 BER
- [x] SNMP v1
- [ ] SNMP v2
- [ ] SNMP v3
- [ ] Integrated with TLS
- [ ] Replace Bytes crate

# Optimization
- [ ] Use unsafe code to avoid copying
- [ ] 

# Usage Example

## Client

## Server(Agent)
